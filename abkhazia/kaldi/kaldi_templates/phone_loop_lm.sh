###### Parameters ######
# directory generated by phone_loop_lm.py containing all the info about the desired lm
in_dir=data/local/phone_loop
# output directory
out_dir=data/phone_loop
# tmp directory
tmp_dir=data/local/phone_loop_tmp
# log file
log=data/prepare_phone_loop.log


###### Recipe ######
[ -f cmd.sh ] && source ./cmd.sh \
  || echo "cmd.sh not found. Jobs may not execute properly."

. path.sh || { echo "Cannot source path.sh"; exit 1; }

# first need to do a prepare_lang in the desired folder to get to use the "phone" lexicon
# irrespective of what was used as a lexicon in training:
utils/prepare_lang.sh --position-dependent-phones true \
  $in_dir "<unk>" $tmp_dir $out_dir \
  >& $log
# here we could use a different silence_prob 
# I think however that --position-dependent-phones has to be the same
# as what was used for training (as well as the phones.txt, extra_questions.txt
# and nonsilence_phones.txt, otherwise the mapping between phones and acoustic state
# in the trained model will be lost

# then compile the text format FST to binary format used by kaldi in utils/mkgraph.sh
fstcompile --isymbols=$out_dir/words.txt --osymbols=$out_dir/words.txt --keep_isymbols=false \
--keep_osymbols=false $in_dir/G.txt > $out_dir/G.fst
