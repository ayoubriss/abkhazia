Japanese Corpora
===============

Please note that the japanese corpora preparator (CSJ & globalphone) 
are WIP. For now, they need a file named "kana-to-phon_bootphon.txt"
in their input folders ( /input_folder/kana-to-phon_bootphon.txt).

** GlobalPhone
Since not all phones used in the GlobalPhone romanized transcription
are in kana-to-phon_bootphon.txt, the preparator exports a list of 
all the unknown phones in :
	/input_folder/unknown_GP.txt

** CSJ
The CSJ preparator for now still uses the "core" preparator for core
files, and uses the "non_core" preparator for non_core files. This 
should be changed in the future, to homogenise the transcription 

**TODO
A list (probably non-exhaustive) of things to do can be found in 
TODO.org, I will do them as quickly as possible...
