# Could be useful when using a lexicon that is tailored to the corpus
# to the point of overfitting (i.e. only words occuring in the corpus
# were included and many other common words weren't), which could lead
# to overestimated performance on words from the lexicon appearing in
# the test only. Removes from the lexicon all words that are not
# present at least once in the training set.
