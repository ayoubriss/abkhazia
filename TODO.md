- [ ] fix the zip_safe stuff in setup.py... is it an issue ?
- [ ] have a friendly error message when running a command with
  unstasfied dependancies. For exemple, trying to train a corpus which
  have not been prepared outputs 'please prepare the corpus'
- [ ] have more detailed command description on 'abkhazia <command>
  --help'. Assume the user doesn't know abkhazia or kaldi.

* Corpora preparation

  - WSJ
    There is several utterance-ids used several times in 'text.txt' 5608
    - [X] no duplicates in trs input files (all have different abspath)
    - [X] check for duplicates in different subfolders

  - Buckeye and CSJ
    Some utterances are overlapping in time. For CSJ some overlaps
    are 2, only one is 3. Is it a problem ?

* Functions

 - split

   - [X] create a complete corpus (sym links)
   - [X] validate train and test subsets
   - [ ] Move the --prune-lexicon from language to split

 - [-] align

   - [X] test/debug at least on xitsonga, wsj
   - [X] integrate the kaldi2abkhazia conversion script as the final
     step of ForceAlign.run()
   - [X] add support for template options from command-line
   - [ ] remove the language model part from the recipe

 - train(train_set)

   Train an acoustic model (and a simple language model if not provided)
   and test it (providing WER for every model, eventual automatic
   parameter search ?)

   options:
   model type = {monophone, triphone, neural network}
   features = mfcc, mfcc+pitch or custom features (link to the feature_extraction package ?)
   model parameters (eg, nb of mixtures, nb of triphones, questions vs data-driven,speaker_readapt)
   output: acoustic_model (r√©pertoire + readme)
   retrain(train_set, acoustic_model)

 - decode(test_set, acoustic_model, (language_model))

   Compute phone posteriograms or transcription. If no language_model
   provided, a default flat unigram one is constructed

   options:
   evaluate(transcription, gold)
   output = {posteriorgrams, transcription}
   speaker_adapt
   output: results (repertoire)

 - list

   As an alternative of the README files, display what is in
   <data-directory> For each corpus: list of present data, recipes and
   results, with the parameters/path they ran from.

* Documentation

  - make a install page, deeper than in readme
  - improve the 'command line' page
  - improve the 'corpus format' page

* NOTES (DPX)

 - feature extraction
   Maybe we could have a separate feature extraction package that
   takes an abkhazia_wav_corpus as input and outputs an
   abkhazia_feat_corpus?  (or should be the feature file be a separate
   one?
 - retraining
   it should be possible to retrain a trained model on a new corpus
   (for instance, specifically retrain silence models, or retrain on a
   bunch of new corpus) Formats: features
