# This script configures abkhazia before installation. It does the
# following:
#
# - check if dependancies are installed (sox, shorten and CMU dict)
#
# - ask for the path to kaldi
#
# - init a default configuration file for abkhazia in abkhazia/share
#
# - init path.sh and cmd.sh in abkhazia/share
#
# Until all is correctly configured, the script fails with an error
# message advising you how to fix the issue. Fix it and rerun the
# script until it succeed.
