Documentation **actually not up to date** can be found
[here](https://github.com/bootphon/abkhazia/wiki)


## Installation

### Install dependencies

Before deploying abkahzia on your system, you need to install the
following dependencies. If they are not available on your system, the
abkhazia configuration script will fail.

* [Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit](http://kaldi-asr.org).

	Follow installation guidelines
    [here](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/install.html). You will have to
    provide the Kaldi directory to abkhazia during configuration.

* [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net), [flac](http://xiph.org/flac) and
  [shorten](http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten) for wav conversion from
  various audio formats.

	sox and flac should be in repositories of every standard Unix
    distribution, for exemple in Debian/Ubuntu:

    	sudo apt-get install flac sox

   	shorten must be installed manually, follow these steps to
       download, compile and install it:

    	wget http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten/dist/src/shorten-3.6.1.tar.gz
   		tar xzf shorten-3.6.1.tar.gz
   		cd shorten-3.6.1
   		./configure
   		make
   		sudo make install


### Install Abkahzia

First run the configuration script. It will check the dependancies for
you and will initialize a default configuration file in
`abkahzia/share/abkahzia.cfg`.

    ./configure.sh

 Rerun this script and correct the prompted configuration errors until
 it succed. Then move to next step:

    python setup.py install
    python setup.py build
