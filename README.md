# Abkhazia

Tools for performing standard ABX and kaldi experiments on speech
corpora in a unified way

Documentation **actually not up to date** can be found
[here](https://github.com/bootphon/abkhazia/wiki)


## Installation

### Install dependencies

Before deploying abkahzia on your system, you need to install the
following dependencies. If they are not available on your system, the
abkhazia configuration script will fail.

* [Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit](http://kaldi-asr.org).

	* Because Kaldi is developed under continuous integration, there
      is no published release to rely on. To ensure the abkhazia
      stability, we therefore  maintain a Kaldi fork that is guaranteed to
      work. Clone it in a directory of your choice and ensure the
      active branch is *abkhazia* (this should be the default):

            git clone git@github.com:bootphon/kaldi.git

    * Once cloned, you have to install Kaldi (configuration and
      compilation ). Follow the instructions from
      [here](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/install.html). Basically, you
      have to do (from the `kaldi` directory):

            cd tools
            ./extras/check_dependancies.sh
            make -j 4  # -j N do a parallel build on N CPUs
            cd ../src
            ./configure
            make depend -j 4
            make -j 4

    * Install kaldi extras tools (SRILM and IRSTLM librairies)
      required by abkhazia. From your local kaldi directory, type:

            cd ./tools
            ./extras/install_irstlm.sh
            ./extras/install_srilm.sh

    * You will have to provide the `kaldi` directory to abkhazia during
      configuration.

* [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net) with flac support and
  [shorten](http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten) for wav conversion from
  various audio formats.

    * sox and flac should be in repositories of every standard Unix
      distribution, for exemple in Debian/Ubuntu:

    	    sudo apt-get install flac sox

   	* shorten must be installed manually, follow these steps to
      download, compile and install it:

    	    wget http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten/dist/src/shorten-3.6.1.tar.gz
            tar xzf shorten-3.6.1.tar.gz
            cd shorten-3.6.1
            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install


### Install Abkahzia

First run the configuration script. It will check the dependancies for
you and will initialize a default configuration file in
`abkahzia/share/abkahzia.cfg`.

    ./configure

 Rerun this script and correct the prompted configuration errors until
 it succed. Then move to next step:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

In case you want to modify and test the code, replace the last step by
``python setup.py develop``.
