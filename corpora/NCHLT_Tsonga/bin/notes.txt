Corrections:
	text.txt:
		removed SIL-ENCE at the beginning and end of each sentence
		replaced [s] by <NOISE>
	lexicon.txt:
		removed <UNK> SPN entry (but left <unk> SPN)
		replaced [s] nse by <noise> NSN as this seems to correspond to noise
		added words not found in the dictionary (they were forgotten from the dev set)
	phones.txt:
		removed nse nse
		added dZh\ ʤh
		added tl_> tl' 
	silences.txt:
		added NSN

Pour plus tard:
	phones.txt: IPA des trucs peut-être à standardiser
