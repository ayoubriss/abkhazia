This folder contains the scripts necessary to prepare raw corpora distribution for use with abkhazia directly. It also contains the prepared data once you have executed a recipe. To use an existing recipe you need the raw distribution for the corresponding corpora, then follow the instructions in the scripts to prepare the data. To create a new recipe see instruction on abkhazia's documentation wiki on GitHub.
