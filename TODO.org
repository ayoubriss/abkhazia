This file lists all the TODOs in abkhazia in the org-mode format

* Installation
** Manage paths to dependancies
fix some paths at installation (maybe in a config file):
    path to kaldi
    path to CMUdict
    path to flac, sox, shorten
* Corpora preparation
** remove cmu_dict parameter and feed it during installation
** Smart overwrite of exitisting wavs
Consume a lot of time, really annoying when debugging preparators
  - [X] remove the --overwrite parameter and do it by default
  - [ ] change the preparator interface to have list_audio_files() and
    convert_wavfile() instead of make_wavs()
** In validation
  - [ ] fix this bug of overlapping utterances (at least in Buckeye,
    see for other corpora)
** WSJ
  - [X] Modify the command line options to prepare all if --type not specified
  - [X] Document this in 'prepare_wsj.py --help'
** GlobalPhone
  - validate Mandarin
  - debug Vietnamese
